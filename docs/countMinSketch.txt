Count min Sketch, count the frequency of events on the streaming data.

it uses multiple hash functions to map these frequencies to matrix.

this algorithm is uses very less space, sometimes it counts more frequencies because of hash pollution.

[A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I] ... infinite stream. in a day could be 1TB/day 30TB/month
A-3
B-2
H-2
I-2
Limited space
limited time
stream only: we will never know where data gone, we don't store the data.

lets learn using 
    hashtable: some of liniar space its not sublinear space, time complexity is o(1) it can varry if collision.
    Sampling: we can sample/random Sampling, we can get the frequencies, that is not useful algorithm.


#Counting Sketch
    it is noting but 2-dimentional array
    number of rows = hash functions
    more accurate result if use more hash functions.

stream could have infinite number of data. [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I]....OO

    how to count frequencies using this mechanism.

we will have rows as a hash function and columns as a values


       function                      
         H1          0   2   0   1   0   0   1
         H2          0   0   2   0   1   0   1
         H3          1   0   0   1   2   0   0
         H4          2   0   0   0   0   0   2

while caculating hash value for each function, columns will be Hash function and rows will be stream data.

data    H1  H2  H3  H4
A       1   6   3   1
B       1   2   4   6       [2,2,2,2] 2 is the minimum count.
C       3   4   1   6
D       6   2   4   1
E


how will calculate the frequencies.

again we will pass the data to all functions, and we get has values for each function.

H1(A)=1
H2(A)=6
H3(A)=3
H4(A)=1

[2+1+1+2] we want minimum of those counts.
minimum number in this is 1.
