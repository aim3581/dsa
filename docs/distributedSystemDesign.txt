It is a group of machines which work to acomplish common goal. this are not super computers\

we have a service which gets a request and convert word document to pdf.
 in 1st month gets 1000 req/second => it was handling
 2nd month gets 10000 req/second  => frequencies
 3rd month gets 1lakh req/second => users are frustrated.  buy new RAM 128 GB
 4th month gets 1million req/second => buy new RAM 500GB

 this is called Vertical scaling.

other user has a same scenario
    in 1st month gets 1000 req/second => it was handling
    2nd month gets 10000 req/second  => frequencies
    3rd month gets 1lakh req/second => users are frustrated.  disributed tasks to other server.
    4th month gets 1million req/second => disributed tasks to 10 other machines which does same task.
    on 10th month 1000 req/second=> no need to all machines running=> shutdown the other servers.
This is called horizontal scaling/distributed system.
    
    Advantages:
        1. Fault tollerance
        2. low latency

servers can be deployed to multiple regions, it will reduce the network delay
e.g. if user  from india try to convert file request will be sent to Asia region server, instead of USA server.
