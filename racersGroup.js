/**
 * n racers are present in the race track. Two arrays X[] and V[] are provided where X[i] and V[i] denote the starting position 
 * and speed of the ith racer. If a racer collides with another one, then both of them move together with the speed of the slower. 
 * Likewise groups of racers are combined to form a single group. Tell the number of groups that will reach the end of the race track. 
 * Answered using disjoint set union.
